## Deliverable 1
### PROBLEM 1 : Outline and approach
##### Tasks to be done here:
1) Define an outline of the solution
2) Come up with the object-oriented design for the problem
3) Construct CRC models
#### Task holders:
Shrawan, Anant, Vishwas

-----------------


### PROBLEM 2 :  Algorithms
##### Tasks to be done here:

 - Algorithm Selection
 - Justification behind selecting an algorithm
 - Pseudo coding and documenting selected algorithms
#### Task holders:
Goutham, Jwalit, Leesha

### PROBLEM 3 :  Implementing Cheers

### Incarnation 1
##### Tasks to be done here:

 - Implement the selected algorithms from scratch without the use of any native support in programming languages. By extension, implement the full solution to the CHEERS problem.
 - Ensure adequate modifiability, readability, reusability, and understandability to the code.
 - Design and implement the following features as reusable functions:
		 - Sine
		 - Cos
		 - Factorial
		 - Bisection method
		 - Calculating  **π**
		 - α calculations
 - Facilitate providing sample outputs and present it as structured plain text.
#### Task holders:
Shrawan, Jwalit, Leesha, Vishwas
#### Incarnation 2
##### Tasks to be done here:
 - Implement the solution to the CHEERS problem after a detailed investigation of all opportunities for reuse
 - Explore native functions and APIs that can support solving the problem efficiently.
 - Ensure adequate modifiability, readability, reusability, and understandability to the code.
 - Facilitate providing sample outputs and express it as in XML.
 
 #### Task holders:
Anant, Goutham

-------------------------
#### For both of the incarnations:
 - Ensure PEP 8 style of programming is followed and sufficient documentation is done
 - Follow established principles of programming discussed at earlier stages
 - Ensure Exception Handling and display of proper error messages
